Sieve of Eratosthenes
---------------------

The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all primes smaller than n when n is smaller than 10 million
It follows where each non-prime elementâ€™s index is marked as 1 inside the nested loops. The prime numbers are those whose index is marked as 0.
