/*
You are at the side of a river. You are given a m litre jug and a n litre jug where 0 < m < n. Both the jugs are initially empty. The jugs donâ€™t have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. You have to use the jugs to measure d litres of water where d < n. Determine the minimum no of operations to be performed to obtain d litres of water in one of jug.
The operations you can perform are:

Empty a Jug
Fill a Jug
Pour water from one jug to the other until one of the jugs is either empty or full.
 

Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 5, d = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: Operations are as follow-
1. Fill up the 5 litre jug.
2. Then fill up the 3 litre jug using 5 litre
   jug. Now 5 litre jug contains 2 litre water.
3. Empty the 3 litre jug.
4. Now pour the 2 litre of water from 5 litre 
   jug to 3 litre jug.
5. Now 3 litre jug contains 2 litre of water 
   and 5 litre jug is empty. Now fill up the 
   5 litre jug.
6. Now fill one litre of water from 5 litre jug 
   to 3 litre jug. Now we have 4 litre water in 
   5 litre jug.
Example 2:

Input: m = 8, n = 56, d = 46
Output: -1
Explanation: Not possible to fill any one of 
the jug with 46 litre of water.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minSteps() which takes m, n and d ans input parameter and returns the minimum number of operation to fill d litre of water in any of the two jug.

// HINT : Consider 2 scenarios ie., always pouring from jug 1 to 2 and always pouring from jug 2 to 1.

int pour(int m, int n, int d) {
    int ans = 1;
    int j1 = m, j2 = 0;
    while (j1 != d && j2 != d) {
        int amt = min(j1, n - j2);
        j1 -= amt;
        j2 += amt;
        ans++;
        
        if (j1 == d || j2 == d)
            break;
            
        if (j1 == 0) {
            j1 = m;
            ans++;
        }
        
        if (j2 == n) {
            j2 = 0;
            ans++;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

int minSteps(int m, int n, int d)
{
    if(m > n) swap(m,n);
      if(d > n || (d % __gcd(n, m) != 0)) return -1;
      
      return min(pour(m, n, d), pour(n, m, d));
}
